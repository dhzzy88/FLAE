# FLAE
The Fast Linear Attitude Estimator (FLAE) proposed by Jin Wu et al. in Feb-2016 during the undergraduate study of Jin Wu. This estimator is aimed to compute the attitude of rigid body (like satellite, vehicles, smart devices and etc.) using 3D vector measurements including star vectors, sun vectors, lunar vectors, geomagnetic vectors, gravitational vectors, visual-tracking points and etc.
